/*-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * INSTRUCTIONS:
 *
 *	1) STREAM requires different amounts of memory to run on different
 *           systems, depending on both the system cache size(s) and the
 *           granularity of the system timer.
 *     You should adjust the value of 'STREAM_ARRAY_SIZE' (below)
 *           to meet *both* of the following criteria:
 *       (a) Each array must be at least 4 times the size of the
 *           available cache memory. I don't worry about the difference
 *           between 10^6 and 2^20, so in practice the minimum array size
 *           is about 3.8 times the cache size.
 *           Example 1: One Xeon E3 with 8 MB L3 cache
 *               STREAM_ARRAY_SIZE should be >= 4 million, giving
 *               an array size of 30.5 MB and a total memory requirement
 *               of 91.5 MB.  
 *           Example 2: Two Xeon E5's with 20 MB L3 cache each (using OpenMP)
 *               STREAM_ARRAY_SIZE should be >= 20 million, giving
 *               an array size of 153 MB and a total memory requirement
 *               of 458 MB.  
 *       (b) The size should be large enough so that the 'timing calibration'
 *           output by the program is at least 20 clock-ticks.  
 *           Example: most versions of Windows have a 10 millisecond timer
 *               granularity.  20 "ticks" at 10 ms/tic is 200 milliseconds.
 *               If the chip is capable of 10 GB/s, it moves 2 GB in 200 msec.
 *               This means the each array must be at least 1 GB, or 128M elements.
 *
 *      Version 5.10 increases the default array size from 2 million
 *          elements to 10 million elements in response to the increasing
 *          size of L3 caches.  The new default size is large enough for caches
 *          up to 20 MB. 
 *      Version 5.10 changes the loop index variables from "register int"
 *          to "ssize_t", which allows array indices >2^32 (4 billion)
 *          on properly configured 64-bit systems.  Additional compiler options
 *          (such as "-mcmodel=medium") may be required for large memory runs.
 *
 *      Array size can be set at compile time without modifying the source
 *          code for the (many) compilers that support preprocessor definitions
 *          on the compile line.  E.g.,
 *                gcc -O -DSTREAM_ARRAY_SIZE=100000000 stream.c -o stream.100M
 *          will override the default size of 10M with a new size of 100M elements
 *          per array.

/*  2) STREAM runs each kernel "NTIMES" times and reports the *best* result
 *         for any iteration after the first, therefore the minimum value
 *         for NTIMES is 2.
 *      There are no rules on maximum allowable values for NTIMES, but
 *         values larger than the default are unlikely to noticeably
 *         increase the reported performance.
 *      NTIMES can also be set on the compile line without changing the source
 *         code using, for example, "-DNTIMES=7".

/*  Users are allowed to modify the "OFFSET" variable, which *may* change the
 *         relative alignment of the arrays (though compilers may change the 
 *         effective offset by making the arrays non-contiguous on some systems). 
 *      Use of non-zero values for OFFSET can be especially helpful if the
 *         STREAM_ARRAY_SIZE is set to a value close to a large power of 2.
 *      OFFSET can also be set on the compile line without changing the source
 *         code using, for example, "-DOFFSET=56".
 */
#ifndef OFFSET
#   define OFFSET	0
#endif

/*
 *	3) Compile the code with optimization.  Many compilers generate
 *       unreasonably bad code before the optimizer tightens things up.  
 *     If the results are unreasonably good, on the other hand, the
 *       optimizer might be too smart for me!
 *
 *     For a simple single-core version, try compiling with:
 *            cc -O stream.c -o stream
 *     This is known to work on many, many systems....
 *
 *     To use multiple cores, you need to tell the compiler to obey the OpenMP
 *       directives in the code.  This varies by compiler, but a common example is
 *            gcc -O -fopenmp stream.c -o stream_omp
 *       The environment variable OMP_NUM_THREADS allows runtime control of the 
 *         number of threads/cores used when the resulting "stream_omp" program
 *         is executed.
 *
 *     To run with single-precision variables and arithmetic, simply add
 *         -DSTREAM_TYPE=float
 *     to the compile line.
 *     Note that this changes the minimum array sizes required --- see (1) above.
 *
 *     The preprocessor directive "TUNED" does not do much -- it simply causes the 
 *       code to call separate functions to execute each kernel.  Trivial versions
 *       of these functions are provided, but they are *not* tuned -- they just 
 *       provide predefined interfaces to be replaced with tuned code.
 *
 *
 *	4) Optional: Mail the results to mccalpin@cs.virginia.edu
 *	   Be sure to include info that will help me understand:
 *		a) the computer hardware configuration (e.g., processor model, memory type)
 *		b) the compiler name/version and compilation flags
 *      c) any run-time information (such as OMP_NUM_THREADS)
 *		d) all of the output from the test case.
 *
 * Thanks!
